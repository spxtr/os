## TODO FIXME PLEASE

* Missing files currently halt the program.
  * Missing scenery should be replaced with a placeholder or nothing at all.
  * Missing textures should use a default.
* Make sure we're loading the appropriate version of files where we have both
  `.png` and `.bmp`.
* Some scenery are incorrectly scaled. It might be due to loading the wrong
  version. See the trees on the sides of `ctf_Ash` for an example.
* Look around with the mouse, zoom with the scrollwheel.
* View colliders, spawnpoints, and waypoints.
* Save screenshots.
* Control with command-line.
* Consider letterboxing instead of cutting off the edges. As currently
  implemented, a w/h ratio other than 4/3 is disadvantageous.
* Polygon edges.
